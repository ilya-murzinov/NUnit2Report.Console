NUnit2Report Console is a tool to transform the NUnit xml results file to an Html user-friendly report using XSL files, the tool was originally designed to be integrated with NAnt as a NAnt task and it was created by Gilles Bayon. This version converts the original NUnittoReportTask to a console version to be able to use it freely without the use of NAnt.

This particular version of NUnit2Report.Console provides another HTML-report which is prettier then original:
